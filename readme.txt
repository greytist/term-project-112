CMU Dating Simulator
(is it even possible!?)

About:

  I created a game where you play as a CMU student, and you have to become friends with
one of two characters in order to ask them out in 3 days time.
  How the game works is that you have relationship stats with the other characters, 
and you have an intelligence stat for yourself. You must answer trivia correctly during 
lecture to gain intelligence. You need a certain ammount of this to be able to win. 
The lecture questions are just random trivia you might not know, so I added a feature 
where every night you gain smarts just from "studying" (advancing to next day). 
  The relationship stats come from 2 different mechanics; the first is the ability 
to choose your own responces during dialogue with the characters. Most of the 
time, one answer gives you points and the other takes them away. The second mechanic is a 
minigame where you must bring la prima coffee to the character. This automatically improves 
your relationship with them. You need a certain amount of relationship with any character to win.
  I tried to make the narration and dialogue as entertaining as I could without it being too
weird. Hope you enjoy!

How to run:

The file you want to run is called " main_file.py ". Most of the code is in here, so it is one
of the bigger files. After you run the main file, all you need to do is have fun.

There are no external libraries.

There are no shortcut commands. Each minigame comes up at least twice. Be careful not to 
click through the dialogue too fast or you could miss something. (just like in real life!)
